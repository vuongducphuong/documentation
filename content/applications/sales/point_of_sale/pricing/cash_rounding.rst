Cash rounding
=============

**Cash rounding** is required when the lowest physical denomination
of currency, or the smallest coin, is higher than the minimum unit
of account.

For example, some countries require their companies to round up or
down the total amount of an invoice to the nearest five cents, when
the payment is made in cash.

Each Điểm bán hàng in Leansoft can be configured to apply cash rounding
to the totals of its bills or receipts.

Configuration
=============

Go to :menuselection:`Điểm bán hàng --> Configuration --> Settings`
and enable *Cash Rounding*, then click on *Save*.

Go to :menuselection:`Điểm bán hàng --> Configuration --> Point of
Sale`, open the Điểm bán hàng you want to configure, and enable the
*Cash Rounding* option.

To define the **Rounding Method**, open the drop-down list and click
on *Create and Edit...*.

Define here your *Rounding Precision*, *Profit Account*, and
*Loss Account*, then save both the Rounding Method and your Point
of Sale settings.
